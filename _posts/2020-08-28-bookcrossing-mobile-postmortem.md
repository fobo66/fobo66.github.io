Hello! Recently I received copyright infringement notice about my favorite pet project, Bookcrossing Mobile app, and was forced to remove the app from Play Store. On this note, I decided to discontinue its development completely and keep its code open and untouched. In this article, I will describe my journey with development of this project, some cool tricks I've learned, as well as provide some description of the project for anyone who may be interested in it.

## History

I've started this project to explore RxJava and Firebase, also to build up my portfolio and to learn. Idea came to my mind when I was browsing Play Store in search of the app to exchange books. I was participating in bookcrossing movement since 2010, when the first shelf appeared in my hometown.
