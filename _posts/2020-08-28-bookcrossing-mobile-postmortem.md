Hello! Recently I received copyright infringement notice about my favorite pet project, Bookcrossing Mobile app, and was forced to remove the app from Play Store. On this note, I decided to discontinue its development completely and keep its code open and untouched. In this article, I will describe my journey with development of this project, some cool tricks I've learned, as well as provide some description of the project for anyone who may be interested in it.
