## General

Valiutchik is developed by one main developer.

Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how information obtained from users is collected, used and disclosed.

By using Valiutchik, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.

## Information being collected

Valiutchik queries info about user's approximate location, with your prior permission, in order to determine correct currency rates to display. Location data is not stored locally and may be sent to Mapbox Inc. third-party service for geocoding. Usage of the data by Mapbox Inc. is subject to their respective [terms of service](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/tos) and [privacy policy](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy). You can enable or disable access to location at any time, through your device settings.

Valiutchik uses internet connection to load info about currency rates. Any personally identifiable data about connection is not collected.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

## Changes to the Policy

If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time to time, so please be sure to review this page periodically. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
