Hello!

Some time ago I learned aboud demoscene in the BBS network in the early 90s. People have created amazing graphical images purely wiith Assembly code on a very limited hardware, and it was so great that even after all these years enthusiasts continue to create new demos and preserve old ones all over the world. I got inspired by the demoscene and decided to try something like this myself. I'm not familiar with Assembly (and, frankly, don't want to touch it), so I chose to create some demos on Android using OpenGL. It might not be as impressive, but at least I can use programming language I am familiar with (Kotlin) to setup some scaffold code for the actual OpenGL graphic code. Unfortunately, the info around computer graphics and OpenGL is quite inconsistent and scattered across different places, so I decided to summarize my learning experiance in one article for future reference, so other people could benefit from this too.

In this article, we're going to walk through the main concepts behind computer graphics and OpenGL in context of Android.
